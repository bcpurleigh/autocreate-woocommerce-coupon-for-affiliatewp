# affiliatewp-create-woocommerce-coupon
**WordPress plugin to create a WooCommerce coupon for every affiliate created through AffiliateWP**

Each time a new affiliate is created in AffiliateWP, this plugin creates a new voucher for them. You can choose amount and type of the voucher.

The voucher will be assigned to the relevant affiliate, so that all customers using the voucher are tracked as referred by the affiliate.

Best used in conjunction with the `affiliatewp-show-affiliate-coupons` plugin to show the affiliate their available coupon codes.
